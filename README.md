## Requirements

Create REST application where we can give an example of CRUD operations and best practices for mostly used languages and frameworks

The app, called CompanyRegister should be able to:

- Add new company ---> _**C**reate_
- List all companies ---> _**R**etreive_
- Update a company ---> _**U**pdate_
- Delete a company ---> _**D**elete_

# Flask API

[Flask](https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) is realy super-easy and lightweight web appliations framework. If you are familiar with any other framework, transition to Flaks is matter of hours and even it is really simple to learn for beginers.

In addition for the example I will use [Flask-RESTIX](https://flask-restx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) extension. The extension encourages best practices with minimal setup.

## Project setup
